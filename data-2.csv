Titrating Guidelines,Titrating Guidelines,"(1) Start at lower dosages ; (2) For certain antidepressants (SSRI/buproprion/SNRI), anxiety disorder patients may start lower dosages (half of starting dose); (3) Slow titration or reduce to prior tolerated dosage if having side effects; (4) Patient preference important; (5) For treatment-naïve patients, may be valuable to go slower given negative side effects can make them less likely to trial future medications; (6) Consider patient ability to understand ease of dosing, e.g. once daily with higher compliance than twice daily so a lower dose may be better; (7) Severity of symptoms and impairment can determine titration speed (e.g. mild anxiety - slower vs suicidal depression - faster); (8) Provide psychoeducation of tapering symptoms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
